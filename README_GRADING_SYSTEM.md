# Faculty Grading System - Complete Documentation

- **Instant feedback** when grades are saved
- **Organized interface** showing all submissions
- **Filtered by subject** - only see exams for assigned subjects
- **Edit anytime** - can modify grades if needed
- **Tracked history** - timestamp and faculty name recorded

    attempt_id = models.CharField(max_length=64) # Unique ID
    semester = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    exam_date = models.DateField()
    marks_obtained = models.DecimalField()       # Grade (0-100)
    max_marks = models.DecimalField()            # Total marks
    remarks = models.TextField()                 # Feedback
    graded_by = models.CharField(max_length=150) # Faculty
