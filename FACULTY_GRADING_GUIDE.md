# Faculty Grading System Guide

## Overview
Faculty members can now grade student exam submissions directly through the system. This guide explains how the grading system works and how to use it.

## How Faculty Grading Works

### 1. Faculty Login
- Faculty members login through the Faculty Login page
- Only approved faculty members can access grading features
- Faculty can have assigned subjects for which they can grade

### 2. Access Grading Interface
After logging in:
1. Click on **"Faculty Dashboard"** 
2. Locate the exam records or navigate to **"Faculty Results"** section
3. You'll see a table showing all student exam submissions

### 3. Grade Student Exams

The Faculty Results page displays:
- **Student Name**: Username of the student who submitted the exam
- **Subject**: The subject of the exam
- **Exam Date**: When the exam was submitted

3. **Enter Max Marks**: Input the maximum marks possible
4. **Add Remarks** (Optional): Enter feedback or comments about the exam
5. **Click "Save"**: Submit the grade

### 4. Subject Assignment
- Faculty can only grade exams for their **assigned subjects**
- If a subject is not assigned to you, it will not appear in your list
- Contact the administrator to assign subjects to your account

### 5. Grade History
- Once a grade is saved, the system shows:
  - When the grade was last updated
  - Who graded it (faculty member's name)
  - Timestamp of the grading

## Features

## Grade Information Tracked

For each exam grade, the system records:
- **Student Username**: Who the exam belongs to
- **Subject**: Which subject was tested
- **Attempt ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Marks Obtained**: The grade you assigned
- **Max Marks**: Total possible marks

## Assignment to Subjects

Administrators assign subjects to faculty members using the admin dashboard:
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Manage Faculty Subject Assignments
3. Assign subjects to faculty members
4. Faculty will immediately see those exams available for grading

## Example Workflow

1. **Admin** assigns Subject "Mathematics" to Faculty "Dr. Smith"
2. **Student** submits an exam for Mathematics
3. **Dr. Smith** logs in and sees the exam in the Faculty Results page
4. **Dr. Smith** enters marks (e.g., 85/100) and remarks (e.g., "Good attempt")
5. **Dr. Smith** clicks Save
6. The system records the grade
7. **Student** can view the grade in their results page

## Notes

- Grades are permanent once saved (though they can be edited)
- Only faculty assigned to a subject can grade exams for that subject
- The system prevents unauthorized grade submission through validation checks
- All grade activities are logged with timestamps and faculty member names
