# Implementation Complete: Faculty Grading System

## Summary

Faculty members can now successfully **grade student exams** by entering marks, maximum marks, and providing feedback/remarks for each student.

## What Was Done

### 1. Enhanced Faculty Grading Template

- Restructured grading form for inline submission
- Each exam row has its own complete form
- Added JavaScript for smooth form submission
- Real-time success notifications
- Visual loading indicators
- Improved responsive design

### 2. Backend Enhancement
**File**: `app/views.py`
- Added `api_submit_grade()` function for dedicated grade submission
- Enhanced validation and error handling
- Server-side subject assignment verification
- Proper CSRF protection
- Decimal field parsing for marks
- Comprehensive error messages

### 3. URL Routing
**File**: `app/urls.py`

- Supports both POST requests

## How Faculty Grading Works

### Before (Issue):

    subject = models.CharField(max_length=255)    # Subject name
    attempt_id = models.CharField(max_length=64)  # Unique ID
    semester = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    exam_date = models.DateField()
    marks_obtained = models.DecimalField()        # Grade awarded
    max_marks = models.DecimalField()             # Total marks
    remarks = models.TextField()                   # Feedback
    graded_by = models.CharField(max_length=150)  # Faculty name
    graded_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)  # When graded
```

## Testing Instructions
